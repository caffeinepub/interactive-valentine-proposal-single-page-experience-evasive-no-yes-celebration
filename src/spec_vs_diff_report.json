  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3/4 are largely implemented: NO button now auto-moves on mount with safe bounds and remains non-focusable/unclickable; the exact new phrase is present; heart particles support a denser, bottom-biased mode after YES. One aspect of REQ-1 (“slightly faster” on hover/tap attempts) is not evidenced in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On hover/tap attempts, the evasive NO button should become “slightly faster” in addition to random relocation, shrinking, and phrase progression.",
      "reason": "The hook decreases size and changes position on interaction, but no speed/interval/animation-duration change tied to attempt count is shown. Auto-movement uses a fixed 2000ms interval and does not change based on attempts.",
